## Run

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
Along with that you would need [mongoose](https://www.mongodb.com/) or you can install it locally. You would also need [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the link is available in my repo.

> Assuming that you have already setup for your mongodb and allowed access and also entered your system's IP ADDRESS.
> To run the project, download the source code and run it in visual studio, then follow the steps

```
$ npm install dotenv
In your config file  require('dotenv').config()
Create .env file in your root folder
Create variables and assign values
```

```
PW = Enter your mongo db password
PORT = Enter your desired PORT number
DBNAME = Enter your mongodb name

```
